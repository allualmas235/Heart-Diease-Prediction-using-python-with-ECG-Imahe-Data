# Heart-Diease-Prediction-using-python-with-ECG-Image-Data
 Heart-disease-prediction-using-python-with-ECG-data  Heart disease is a significant global health issue responsible for millions of deaths annually. Modifiable risk factors such as high cholesterol, smoking, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure can be tackled through lifestyle changes and medical interventions. In this study, the logistic regression model from Scikit-Learn was employed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on various risk factors. highlighting the need for further research and development to improve accuracy, applicability, and clinical utility. The development of effective prevention and treatment strategies using advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning is crucial in reducing the impact of this disease on individuals and society as a whole. This project is predicting about heart diseases. In olden days we can estimate that particular aged people are getting heart diseases. But now a  days it is common to all .we can’t estimate. 
That’s why this project is helpful for Predict the result whether the patient has heart disease or normal. This prediction will make it faster and more efficient in healthcare sectors which will be a time-consuming
